## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   
   N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   
   I did not encounter any challenges completing the required functionality or some of the optional features. If I had more time, I would be able to finish more optional features relatively easily.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   In a web development project with multiple collaborators, how is the work organized? Will different members have different roles to implement a selected type of files? E.g. one person is responsible for the CSS, another person is responsible for the JavaScript.
   Also, what is a good organization of a website with multiple pages?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   
   I would definitely add some additional features if I had more time to work on this project. Refining the fonts and locations of different elements, adding more squares and tunes, simple animations to indicate losing/wining the game, are some features I can possibly implement if I had a few more hours.
